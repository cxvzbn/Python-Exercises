# In English, the present participle is formed by adding the suffix ­ing to the infinite form: go ­> going. A simple
# set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:
# 1. If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add ing (if not exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
# 2. If the verb ends in ie, change ie to y and add ing
# 3. For words consisting of consonant­vowel­consonant, double the final letter before adding ing
# 4. By default just add ing
# Your task in this exercise is to define a function make_ing_form()which given a verb in infinitive form
# returns its present participle form. Test your function with words such as lie, see, move and hug. However,
# you must not expect such simple rules to work for all cases.
